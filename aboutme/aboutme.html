    <h3>Nickname from my kids: But Muuuuuuum</h3>
    <p>I am currently a stay-at-home mother living in Zurich, Switzerland with my husband, 
    two step-daughters aged 15 and 8 and my son who is almost 18 months old. I am
    originally from England, but moved to Switzerland to be with my family. I speak
    English, French, German and Swiss-German.</p>
    <p>I completed Pathway Connect in the summer, and I am excited for the opportunity it
    has given me to pursue a career in technology. This is something that I hope I will be
    able to use to bless my family and support my husband with his growing business.</p>
    <p>One of my favourite spiritual quotes is: "The greatest miracle of them all is that the
    Savior is with you every step of the way."</p>
